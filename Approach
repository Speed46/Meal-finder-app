problem statement : Create a meal app to store and search meals. Use ONLY vanilla javascript, no libraries or 
frameworks allowed for Javascript (you can use any css framework like Bootstrap).



Approach and Steps for Creating a Meal App using Vanilla JavaScript:

1. Design the User Interface:
   - Use HTML and CSS (Bootstrap framework) to create a visually appealing layout for the app.
   - Create input fields, buttons, and containers to display meals and search results.

2. Set up the Data Structure:
   - Define a data structure to store meal information.
   - Each meal could have properties like name, ingredients, instructions, and an image URL.
   - Consider using an array or object to hold multiple meal objects.

3. Populate the Meal Data:
   - Add sample meal data to the app.
   - Create a function to load and display meals on the app's interface.
   - Display meals with their names and images.

4. Implement Search Functionality:
   - Create an input field for users to enter search queries.
   - Implement a search function to filter meals based on the entered query.
   - Match the query against meal names or ingredients and display the matching results.

5. Display Meal Details:
   - Add event listeners to meal cards or buttons to trigger the display of meal details.
   - Design a separate section to show the selected meal's name, image, ingredients, and instructions.
   - Use JavaScript to update the displayed meal details based on user interaction.

6. Add Create and Store Functionality:
   - Allow users to add new meals to the app.
   - Create an input form to gather meal information such as name, ingredients, and instructions.
   - Store the newly created meal in the data structure and update the app's interface accordingly.

7. Implement Edit and Delete Functionality:
   - Enable users to edit and delete existing meals.
   - Add buttons or icons for editing and deleting meals.
   - Implement functions to modify or remove meals from the data structure and update the app's interface.

8. Ensure Data Persistence:
   - Store the meal data in the browser's local storage to maintain the data between app sessions.
   - Load the stored data when the app initializes and save any changes made by the user.

9. Polish the User Experience:
   - Test the app thoroughly to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
   - Add error handling and validation to ensure data integrity.
   - Optimize the app's performance by refactoring and optimizing code where necessary.

10. Deploy and Share the App:
    - Host the app on a server or deploy it using platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify.
    - Share the app with others and gather feedback for further improvements.
